"""Prep-layer: turn a UnifiedMessage into render-ready HTML from STRUCTURED data.

Why this exists (the §0 root problem from docs/UMBAU.md):

The old render path took a message's flattened ``content`` string — which for
Claude looks like ``"prose\n[Tool: Read] /x\n[Tool Result]\n..."`` — and
re-parsed the tool calls back out of it with regex. That threw away the
structured data the extractor already had (args as a dict, the paired result,
status) and produced call/result blocks that were never linked to each other.

Now that the extractor attaches each tool result to its ``tool_use`` dict as
``output`` (Axis 1), we can render straight from ``message.tool_calls``:
the prose comes from ``content`` with the ``[Tool: …]`` noise stripped, and the
tool cards come from the structured list — call and its result rendered
together, in order.

The actual HTML for a tool card still comes from the existing, already-decent
``format_tool_display`` / ``format_tool_result`` helpers; this layer only
decides WHAT to render from WHICH source, so the messy routing logic lives here
instead of inside the 2700-line template file. Output is sanitized HTML (the
formatters escape their inputs and the caller runs nh3 over the composed page).
