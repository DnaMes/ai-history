"""MCP tool handler groups.

``create_server()`` in :mod:`lore.interfaces.mcp` stays a thin
assembler: it builds the :class:`~lore.interfaces.mcp_tools.deps.MCPToolDeps`
bundle of shared helpers and calls each group module's ``register(server, deps)``.

Each module exposes a ``register`` function that registers its tools with an
unchanged name, description, input schema and handler logic.
