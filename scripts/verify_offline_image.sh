# verify_offline_image.sh — confirm the Docker image can embed offline (issue #101).
#
# Background
# ----------
# The Dockerfile pre-downloads the bge-small embedding model at build time
# (FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH=/opt/fastembed-cache) so the container can serve
# semantic search without ever hitting the HuggingFace Hub. If the warmup
# layer misses a file the container will silently fall back to FTS — exactly
# what issue #94 was meant to prevent. Issue #101 tracks running the smoke
# test that proves the warmup actually works.
#
# This script automates the verification recipe from the issue body. Run it
# in an environment with working Docker DNS (the local daemon in some setups
# can't resolve deb.debian.org — issue body).
#
# Usage
# -----
#   scripts/verify_offline_image.sh                  # default: lore-app:latest
#   IMAGE=foo:bar scripts/verify_offline_image.sh    # override image tag
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0   offline embed + build-info both reported the semantic backends as
#       available (embeddings_available and sqlite_vec_available both true).
#   1   one of the assertions failed (see output for which).
#   2   docker / curl / jq is missing.
#   3   the image was not built locally — run `docker compose build app` first.
#
# Requires: docker, python3 (used both to drive the offline embed probe and
# to fetch + parse /api/build-info from inside the container — no jq, no
# curl-in-container dependency).
